Description TBA

A basic understanding of the command line and R is a prerequisite for success in this course. We recommend beginners enroll in our introductory courses in CLI and R. After a brief review on the first day of the course,  we will not be providing instruction in basic CLI or R.

This workshop will be held online from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day.

Participants must supply their own laptop with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).
