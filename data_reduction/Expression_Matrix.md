# Generating a Gene Expression Matrix

Most analyses have two stages: data reduction and biological analysis.
Statistical analyses of scRNA-seq data take as their starting point an __expression matrix__, where each row represents a gene and each column represents a sample (in scRNAseq a cell). Each entry in the matrix represents the number of reads (expression level) of a particular gene in a given sample (cell). In most cases the number of unique reads (post umi filtering) assigned to that gene in that sample/cell. Generating the expression matrix often involves some, or all, of the following.

### Preprocessing and mapping reads

Raw fastq files first need to be preprocessed, extracting any elements that are a part of the sequence read.

* Library Barcode (library Index) - Used to pool multiple libraries on one sequencing lane
* Cell Barcode (10x Barcode) – Used to identify the cell the read came from
* Unique Molecular Index (UMI) – Used to identify reads that arise during PCR replication
* Sequencing Read – Used to identify the gene a read came from

The remaining sequences are mapped to a reference genome. We tend to use the [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) aligner. For large full-transcript datasets from well annotated organisms (e.g. mouse, human) pseudo-alignment methods (e.g. [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/), [Salmon](http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html)) are also a good choice for alignment. For __full-length__ datasets with tens- or hundreds of thousands of reads per cell pseudo-aligners become more appealing since their run-time can be several orders of magnitude less than traditional aligners.

__Note__, if _spike-ins_ are used, the _spike-in_ sequences should be added to the reference sequence prior to mapping.

### Mapping QC

After aligning sequence data to the genome we should evaluate the quality of the mapping. There are many ways to measure the mapping quality, including: percentage mapped, amount of reads which map to rRNA/tRNAs, proportion of uniquely mapped reads, reads mapping across splice junctions, read depth along the transcripts, etc. Methods developed for bulk RNAseq, such as [RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/) and [samtools](http://samtools.github.io/), are applicable to single-cell data:

### Gene Counting

STAR, Kallisto, and Salmon all quantify the expression level of each gene for
each cell as a part of its output. If UMIs were used, duplicates need to be first marked and then gene expression levels recounted. The packages (`UMI-tools`)[https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools) can be used to process and correct UMIs.


Specific steps to be performed are dependent on the type of library, the element layout of the read, and the sequencing parameters.

## scRNAseq Libraries

Generating scRNAseq libraries is currently an active area of research with several protocols being published in the last few years, including:

* CEL-seq Hashimshony, 2012
* CEL-seq2 Hashimshony, 2016
* DroNC-seq Habib, 2017
* Drop-seq Macosko, 2015
* InDrop-seq Klein, 2015
* MATQ-seq Sheng, 2017_2018
* MARS-seq Jaitin, 2014
* SCRB-seq Soumillon, 2014
* Seq-well Gierahn, 2017
* Smart-seq Picelli, 2014
* Smart-seq2 Picelli, 2014
* SMARTer [clontech](http://www.clontech.com/US/Products/cDNA_Synthesis_and_Library_Construction/Next_Gen_Sequencing_Kits/Total_RNA-Seq/Universal_RNA_Seq_Random_Primed)
* STRT-seq Islam, 2014

Differences between the methods are are in how they capture and quantify gene expression (either __full-length__ or __tag-based__).

__Full-length__ capture tries to achieve a uniform coverage of each transcript (many reads per transcript). __Tag-based__ protocols only capture either the 5'- or 3'-end of each tran script (single read per transcript). Choice in method determines what types of analyses the data can be used for. __Full-length__ capture can be used to distinguish different iso-forms, where __tag-based__ method is best used for only gene abundance.

* __Tag-based__ 3’ counting techniques
	* 1 read per transcript
	* Based on polyA
	* Expression analysis only
	* Fewer reads per cell needed neede (~20K reads/cell 10x V3)
	* Less noise in expression patterns
* __Full-length__
	* Based on polyA
	* Expression analysis
	*  Splicing information
	*  The more information desired beyond expression, the higher the reads needed per cell (~50K reads/cell to 10M reads/cell)


For smaller experiments < 5000 cells, the R packages [`SingleCellExperiment`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment), [`scater`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater/), [`SC3`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SC3.html) are good choices. For larger experiments (> 5000 cells), the R package [`Seurat`](http://satijalab.org/seurat/) offers a complete solution.

A nice page keeping track of single-cell software can be found [here](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell).

### Cell barcode and UMI filtering

* Cell barcodes
	* Must be on static list of known cell barcode sequences
	* May be 1 mismatch away from the list if the mismatch occurs at a low- quality position (the barcode is then corrected).

* UMIs (Unique Molecular Index)
	* Must not be a homopolymer, e.g. AAAAAAAAAA
	* Must not contain N
	* Must not contain bases with base quality < 10
	*	UMIs that are 1 mismatch away from a higher-count UMI are corrected to that UMI if they share a cell barcode and gene.


### Alignment

#### Genome Alignment
cellranger uses an aligner called STAR, which performs splicing-aware alignment of reads to the genome. cellranger uses the transcript annotation GTF to bucket the reads into exonic, intronic, and intergenic, and by whether the reads align (confidently) to the genome. A read is exonic if at least 50% of it intersects an exon, intronic if it is non-exonic and intersects an intron, and intergenic otherwise.

#### MAPQ adjustment
For reads that align to a single exonic locus but also align to 1 or more non-exonic loci, the exonic locus is prioritized and the read is considered to be confidently mapped to the exonic locus with MAPQ 255.

#### Transcriptome Alignment
cellranger further aligns exonic reads to annotated transcripts, looking for compatibility. A read that is compatible with the exons of an annotated transcript, and aligned to the same strand, is considered mapped to the transcriptome. If the read is compatible with a single gene annotation, it is considered uniquely (confidently) mapped to the transcriptome. Only reads that are confidently mapped to the transcriptome are used for UMI counting.

### UMI Counting

* Using only the confidently mapped reads with valid barcodes and UMIs,
	* Correct the UMIs
		UMIs are corrected to more abundant UMIs that are one mismatch away in sequence (hamming distance = 1).
	* Record which reads are duplicates of the same RNA molecule (PCR duplicates)
	* Count only the unique UMIs as unique RNA molecules
	* These UMI counts form an unfiltered gene-barcode matrix.  


### Filtering cells (the 10x way)

cellranger 3.0 introduces and improved cell-calling algorithm that is better able to identify populations of low RNA content cells, especially when low RNA content cells are mixed into a population of high RNA content cells. For example, tumor samples often contain large tumor cells mixed with smaller tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and researchers may be particularly interested in the TIL population. The new algorithm is based on the EmptyDrops method (Lun et al., 2018).

The algorithm has two key steps:

1. It uses a cutoff based on total UMI counts of each barcode to identify cells. This step identifies the primary mode of high RNA content cells.
2. Then the algorithm uses the RNA profile of each remaining barcode to determine if it is an “empty" or a cell containing partition. This second step captures low RNA content cells whose total UMI counts may be similar to empty GEMs.

In the first step, the original cellranger cell calling algorithm is used to identify the primary mode of high RNA content cells, using a cutoff based on the total UMI count for each barcode. cellranger takes as input the expected number of recovered cells, N (see --expect-cells). Let m be the 99th percentile of the top N barcodes by total UMI counts. All barcodes whose total UMI counts exceed m/10 are called as cells in the first pass.

In the second step, a set of barcodes with low UMI counts that likely represent ‘empty’ GEM partitions is selected. A model of the RNA profile of selected barcodes is created. This model, called the background model, is a multinomial distribution over genes. It uses Simple Good-Turing smoothing to provide a non-zero model estimate for genes that were not observed in the representative empty GEM set. Finally, the RNA profile of each barcode not called as a cell in the first step is compared to the background model. Barcodes whose RNA profile strongly disagrees with the background model are added to the set of positive cell calls. This second step identifies cells that are clearly distinguishable from the profile of empty GEMs, even though they may have much lower RNA content than the largest cells in the experiment.

Below is an example of a challenging cell-calling scenario where 300 high RNA content 293T cells are mixed with 2000 low RNA content PBMC cells. On the left is the cell calling result with the cell calling algorithm prior to cellranger 3.0 and on the right is the current cellranger 3.0 result. You can see that low RNA content cells are successfully identified by the new algorithm.

### Bam output

10x Chromium cellular and molecular barcode information for each read is stored as TAG fields:

| Tag	| Type	| Description
|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| CB	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode sequence that is error-corrected and confirmed against a list of known-good barcode sequences. |
| CR	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| CY	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| UB	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode sequence that is error-corrected among other molecular barcodes with the same cellular barcode and gene alignment. |
| UR	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| UY	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| BC	| Z		| Sample index read. |

| TQ	| Z		| Trimmed sequence quality. Phred scores as reported by the sequencer. No longer present in V3 |

The following TAG fields are present if a read maps to the genome __and__ overlaps an exon by at least one base pair. A read may align to multiple transcripts and genes, but it is only considered confidently mapped to the transcriptome it if mapped to a single gene.

| Tag	| Type	| Description
|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| TX	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of transcripts that are compatible with this alignment. Transcripts are specified with the transcript_id key in the reference GTF attribute column. The format of each entry is [transcript_id],[strand][pos],[cigar], where strand is either + or -, pos is the alignment offset in transcript coordinates, and cigar is the CIGAR string in transcript coordinates. |
| AN	| Z		| Same as the TX tag, but for reads that are aligned to the antisense strand of annotated transcripts. V3 ONLY. |
| GX	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of gene IDs that are compatible with this alignment. Gene IDs are specified with the gene_id key in the reference GTF attribute column. |
| GN	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of gene names that are compatible with this alignment. Gene names are specified with gene_name key in the reference GTF attribute column. |
| MM	| i		| Set to 1 if the genome-aligner (STAR) originally gave a MAPQ < 255 (it multi-mapped to the genome) and cellranger changed it to 255 because the read overlapped exactly one gene. |
| RE	| A		| Single character indicating the region type of this alignment (E = exonic, N = intronic, I = intergenic). |

The following are feature barcoding TAG fields which are not aligned to the genome, but processed by the Feature Barcodng read processor. The BAM file will contain unaligned records for these reads, with the following tags representing the Feature Barcode sequence extracted from the read, and the feature reference it was matched to, if any. The BAM read sequence will contain all the bases outside of the cell barcode and UMI regions. V3 ONLY.

|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| fb	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode sequence that is error-corrected and confirmed against known features barcode sequences from the feature reference. |
| fr	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| fq	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |

### 10X genomics html reports

Cell ranger does produce a pretty html report with the same statistics and some "analysis".

[Cell Ranger V2 web summary](web_summaryV2.html)

[Cell Ranger V3 web summary](web_summaryV3.html)

#### CellRanger V4 Updates

* Targeted Gene Expression analysis (New application)
* When analyzing 3’ Gene Expression data, Cell Ranger 4.0 trims the template switch oligo (TSO) sequence from the 5’ end of Read-2 and the poly-A sequence from the 3’ end before aligning reads to the reference transcriptome. This behavior is different from Cell Ranger 3.1, which does not perform any trimming. Reports improved mapping.
