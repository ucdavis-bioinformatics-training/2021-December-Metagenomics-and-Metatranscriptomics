# Quick Introduction to the Workshop and Core

__The mission of the Bioinformatics Core facility is to facilitate outstanding omics-scale research through these activities:__

## Staff and Students
Our team offers custom bioinformatics services to academic and private organizations. We have a strong academic background with a focus on cutting edge, open source software. We replicate standard analysis pipelines (best practices) when appropriate, and/or develop novel applications and pipelines when needed, however we always emphasize biological interpretation of the data.

## Structure of the Virtual Workshops

Given the current Covid19 pandemic, we've decided to provide a hybrid format to our workshop. Our intent is to offer as much opportunity as possible to everyone who is interested in our workshop. We will hold the same goals and strive for a similar lecture/hand-on ratio. We will be using multiple technologies in order to help facilitate a maximum amount of interaction.

#### Zoom

Course lecture, discussions, and one-on-one help/troubleshooting will be conducted using a zoom meeting.

  * Participants will be provided one-on-one troubleshooting by our staff, screen sharing and even remote control when needed.
  * The Chat features of Zoom will **not** be our primary mode of text communication as its history is not reliable.
  * We will stick to a schedule to allow people to plan their day and know when they need to be back at their computers for lecture.
  * Video recordings of lectures will be made available to participants.

Because video is involved, we ask everyone to be respectful and we reserve the right to remove someone if they are being disrespectful or disruptive.

####  Slack

Text based communication will be conducted via a Slack channel. Staff will be monitoring the Slack channel to answer questions (and schedule a Zoom break out room if needed). If you know the answer to someone else's question, feel free to answer it.

#### Patience

We ask for a little more patience as this process is also new to us, but we are committed to providing you the best educational experience we can (under the current conditions).

### Workshop Goals

* End to end understanding metagenomic and metatranscriptomic experiment

* To work through a complete experiment, starting from raw data to completion, including making a few figures.

* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

Workshop materials are all posted on github, and publicly available
